1. Locate the folder of the default VLC web interface (in my case it's /usr/share/vlc/lua/http/)

2. Back it up and replace the files with these ones (you can keep requests/ folder)

3. Enable the VLC web interface as described here: https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Modules/http_intf

4. Start VLC, put some songs in the playlist and go to http://localhost:[CHOSEN PORT]

5. After entering your chosen password (look at the link for help), you will be greeted with the VLC web interface
